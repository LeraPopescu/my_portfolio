    <h1>
        A post looking to the future that discusses what youâ€™re looking forward to learning about in the upcoming academic year.
    </h1>

    <p>
        During my second year at university I am looking forward to develop myself even more and I feel I already have very well shaped goals in my mind. First, I want to be involved in more activities that can help me learn more about teamwork and organisational skills and most importantly give me the possibility to help others.
        Then, I want to focus on getting a really good summer internship which can help me get even more prepared for a grauate job. And of course, I'm looking forward to the amazing learning experience at university where I will learn so many new things.

    </p>
    <p>
        As for the different extracuricular activites I am looking forward to this year, I am planning to try to get myself involved in all these activities:
        <ul>
            <li> Continue being vice President for CSS </li>
            <li> Found and lead the Women in Tech Society at the university </li>
            <li> Become a Google Group Developer in Birmingham as a city and continue my networking with the local IT ecosystem and develop myself</li>
            <li> Continue being a Computer Science Ambassador and continue convincing new students what an wonderful university this is and how many opportunities it opened for me</li>
            <li> Work in the team for the Student Developer Club at University to create tech workshops to help students get into Tech</li>
            <li> Be an organiser in Meet IT working towards organising international programming camps, managing tutors for the new tutoring platforms, continue tutoring Philipine children and organising workshops </li>
        </ul>

    </p>

    <p>
        I'm looking forward to getting a really good internship. I already applied and interviewed with few comapnies.
        After some spring weeks I have been fast tracked for interviews for summer internships for the new year.
        Overall, I am looking forward for a great academic year in which I can apply to so many opportunities, like scholarships, career fairs, mentorships and so on..

    </p>

    <p>
        I can't wait to see what other exciting things I will be learning next year.
        I always loved learning new things especially about all different things we can do in Computer Science.
    </p>
    <p>
        Looking at the modules I will have next year, I realised how many interesting things I will have the opportunity to learn
        <ul>
            <li>
                System Programming in C/C++ looked most interesting for me as this is my favourite programming language and I can't wait to see what can this language be applied on in real work life.
            </li>
            <li>
                Functional Programming - I heard from my friends that it's a very cool module which teaches you a different approach to problems and thinking about them recursively (which I really loved in high school)
            </li>
            <li>
                Mathematical Modelling and Decision Making - I always loved Maths and especially how it was taught in my first year and would love to see more about how Maths is applied in Computer Science
            </li>
            <li>
                Software Engineering - this is the niche of Computer Science that I want to specialise in and would definitely love to learn more about what makes one a good Software Engineer
            </li>
            <li>
                Security and Networks - In this day and age almost everything is happening online so I think Security and Networks is such a complicated but crucial part of Computer Science in making sure the users of the product you are doing, feel safe
            </li>
            <li>
                Team Project - I heard different stories about how my friend's team project went. Some of them got lucky with team members, some of them didn't feel they got on well with them, but I think getting team work experience is a very important skill that people need to have before going into work and I am very excited to get this experience
            </li>


        </ul>
