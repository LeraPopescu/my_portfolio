        SHORT DESCRIPTION OF HOW DJANGO WORKS
    </p>

    <p>
        Django is a framework that allows you to develop complicated application with little code and very organised structure. Django has anything you need for you to get up and running your website. It has its command line, web server, database, so you don't really need to do anything else.

        Creating an app is easy. You just need to run (python django-admin.py startproject projectname) which will create a new folder with the projectname that you mentioned and it will already have the files that you can use to set up some settings. You can then create an app (python manage.py startapp appname).

    </p>
    <p>
        In your app you will see these files
        <ul>
            <li>
                models.py to design your models
            </li>
            <li>
                urls.py to write your navigation urls
            </li>
            <li>
                views.py to create your views, templates
            </li>
        </ul>

    </p>
    <p>
        The models.py file is a very extraordinary organised way to look over the data that you have and how you represent your data. This is the file that shows how are your objects shown in your database.
        For example I have three models for Jobs, Projects and Blog Posts. Models and databases are very easy way to handle more data. Now instead of writing down all my work experience in html file, I have a list of jobs in my database which I load and for every item in the list I show them in the html file. All with very little and very organised coding.

        The urls.py describes the navigation between pages. For example when I click on a blog post in my website, a new page will appear, and there are some parameters that I sent in order for my app to know which information it should show on the page.

        The views.py file is the one that wraps up all the data it has and sends the necessary details and triggers the pages that you want to be shown.


    </p>

    <p>
        So when you launch you django web app, it firstly looks into your urls to see what patterns you've created and decides which view to show you. A request is made from the view to render the template that you want.
        The views file processes the request with potential collection of data from database and renders the appropriate page and maybe sends some data from database that will be renedered on the page. The view passes the information to the requested page and the template that you created then shows the data in the format that you created.
    </p>
